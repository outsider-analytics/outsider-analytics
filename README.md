## I'm currently working full time on a grant from the Ethereum Foundation
### Overview

To collect data on the performance and security characteristics of ZK circuits being verified on the Ethereum Blockchain and expose this data to users in a digestible way.

### Project Details 

The end goal of this project is to bring users the ability to identify and understand the details of ZK circuits being used on Ethereum. The current landscape of projects and their implementation techniques are difficult to distinguish for the non-ZK expert. Not all circuits are created equal, and our goal is to help users identify the security/performance trade-offs being made.

How that looks practically: 
* Determine the most useful performance/security metrics for ZK circuits on Ethereum.
* Create a Github repo with data collected and collection methodology publicaly available.
* Make a simple website with data provided on specific ZK circuits desired by user
* Contribute an improvement to Otterscan that displays ZK circuit info in block explorer
